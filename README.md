Manga Filename Grammar
======================

[manga-filename-grammar.pro](manga-filename-grammar.pro) defines a Prolog
grammar which can be used to parse or generate filenames according to [Daiz's
scheme](https://github.com/Daiz/manga-naming-scheme). This file is targeted at
SWI-Prolog. I have no idea if it works with other implementations.
